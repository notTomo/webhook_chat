# webhook_chat
A small test project that I made to test discord webhook.

Basically just a client and server for a small local chat. It can be expanded to be of use across programs and servers.
I have implemented this into a few of my GUIs.

## To-do:
Make it so the client will also recieve messages from other clients.
- My work around to this was just print all information from the server to my GUI.

## What you'll need

PS> vcpkg install cpprestsdk cpprestsdk:x64-windows
```
